<p id="para1">Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February; it is among the most important holidays in Vietnam. Officially, the festival includes the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar; however, Vietnamese people often spend nearly a month celebrating this special event.</p>
<p id="para2">Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year; however, its preparation starts long before that. The 23rd day of the last Lunar month is East Dayâ€”a ritual worshiping Kitchen Gods (Tao Cong). It thought that each year on this day, these Gods go to heaven to tell Jade Emperor about all activities of households on earth.</p>
